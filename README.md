I developed â€œðŸŒ¿Cotton Plant Disease Prediction" Deep learning. As Farmer, I know Farmer canâ€™t solve Farmâ€™s complex and even small problems due to lack of perfect education. So as AI enthusiastic I decided to solve this problem using the latest technology like AI.

I just took baby step and start to collect lots of images of cotton crop plants from my farm. To collect accurate data we need expertise in that domain and as a farmer it help me a lot.

Then I decide which algorithm is best to solve this problem and I selectes RESNET model. I create my own CNN architecture and it works well on the training and as well as testing dataset.

As I increased the number of Epochs the accuracy of the model also increased
